# Tripmate
Final Year Project
a web-based travel planning application (TRIPMATE) utilizing OpenStreetMap for interactive route visualization and dynamic stoppage suggestions tailored to user travel speed preferences (Express, Standard, Relax). Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to display real-time weather forecasts at each stop and a custom hotel API (5,000+ entries) to recommend accommodations based on user budget and proximity, implementing intelligent estimation logic to optimize travel itineraries.
Tools: OpenStreetMap API, OpenWeatherMap API, Custom Hotel Database/API, JavaScript, HTML/CSS.
